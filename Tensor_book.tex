The theory of relativity is intimately connected
with the theory of space and time. I shall therefore begin with a brief
investigation of the origin of our ideas of space and time, although in
doing so I know that I introduce a controversial subject. The object of all
science, whether natural science or psychology, is to co-ordinate our
experiences and to bring them into a logical system. How are our customary
ideas of space and time related to the character of our experiences?

\chapter{Metric Tensor}

Consider a vector that is represented in the Cartesian coordinate system and ***

You can use the Pythagoras' Theorem \(a^2+b^2=c^2\) to find its length

\begin{align*}
  ||\vec{v}||^2
  &= \left(v^1\right)^2+\left(v^2\right)^2 \\
  &= \left(3\right)^2+\left(4\right)^2 \\
  &= 25
\end{align*}
\begin{align*}
  \therefore ||\vec{v}||=\sqrt{25}=5
\end{align*}


But what if the vector is measured in this coordinate system? How would you measure its length? Let's try using Pythagoras' theorem and see if we get the same answer.

 \begin{align*}
||\vec{v}||^2
&= \left(\tilde{v}^1\right)^2+\left(\tilde{v}^2\right)^2 \\
&= \left(\frac{7}{5}\right)^2+\left(\frac{13}{5}\right)^2 \\
&= \frac{218}{25}
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
\therefore ||\vec{v}|| = \sqrt{\frac{218}{25}} \approx 2.95?
\end{align*}

We got a different answer this time because Pythagoras' theorem only holds for the Cartesian coordinate system. In order to find the length of a vector in another coordinate system, recall that:

 \begin{align*}
   ||\vec{v}||^2
   = \vec{v}\cdot\vec{v}
 \end{align*}

 If we represent the vector in terms of the Cartesian coordinate system, we get the Pythagoras' Theorem back.

\begin{align*}
  \vec{v}\cdot\vec{v}
  &= (v^1\vec{e}_1+v^2\vec{e}_2) \cdot (v^1\vec{e}_1+v^2\vec{e}_2) \\
  &= v^1v^1(\vec{e}_1\cdot \vec{e}_1)+v^1v^2(\vec{e}_1\cdot \vec{e}_2)+v^2v^1(\vec{e}_2\cdot \vec{e}_1)+v^2v^2(\vec{e}_2\cdot \vec{e}_2) \\
  &= (v^1)^2(\vec{e}_1\cdot \vec{e}_1)+2v^1v^2(\vec{e}_1\cdot \vec{e}_2)+(v^2)^2(\vec{e}_2\cdot \vec{e}_2) \\
  &= (v^1)^2+(v^2)^2 \tag{Because \(\vec{e}_i\cdot\vec{e}_j = \delta_{ij}\)}
 \end{align*}

But if we represent the vector in terms of the basis vectors \(\tilde{e_1}\) and \(\tilde{e_2}\) we get:

\begin{align}
  \vec{v}\cdot\vec{v}
  &= (\tilde{v}^1\tilde{e}_1+\tilde{v}^2\tilde{e}_2) \cdot (\tilde{v}^1\tilde{e}_1+\tilde{v}^2\tilde{e}_2) \nonumber\\
  &= \tilde{v}^1\tilde{v}^1(\tilde{e}_1\cdot \tilde{e}_1)+\tilde{v}^1\tilde{v}^2(\tilde{e}_1\cdot \tilde{e}_2)+\tilde{v}^2\tilde{v}^1(\tilde{e}_2\cdot \tilde{e}_1)+\tilde{v}^2\tilde{v}^2(\tilde{e}_2\cdot \tilde{e}_2) \nonumber \\
  &= (\tilde{v}^1)^2(\tilde{e}_1\cdot \tilde{e}_1)+2\tilde{v}^1\tilde{v}^2(\tilde{e}_1\cdot \tilde{e}_2)+(\tilde{v}^2)^2(\tilde{e}_2\cdot \tilde{e}_2)
\end{align}

To find \((\tilde{e}_1\cdot \tilde{e}_1)\), \((\tilde{e}_1\cdot \tilde{e}_2\)),\((\tilde{e}_2\cdot \tilde{e}_2)\) we represent them in Cartesian coordinates first

\begin{align*}
  \tilde{e}_1\cdot\tilde{e}_1
  &=(2\vec{e}_1+1\vec{e}_2)\cdot(2\vec{e}_1+1\vec{e}_2)\\
  &=2^2(\vec{e}_1\cdot\vec{e}_1)+2(2)(1)(\vec{e}_1\cdot\vec{e}_2)+1^2(\vec{e}_2\cdot\vec{e}_2)\\
  &=2^2+1=5
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
  \tilde{e}_1\cdot\tilde{e}_1
  &=(2\vec{e}_1+1\vec{e}_2)\cdot(2\vec{e}_1+1\vec{e}_2)\\
  &=2^2(\vec{e}_1\cdot\vec{e}_1)+2(2)(1)(\vec{e}_1\cdot\vec{e}_2)+1^2(\vec{e}_2\cdot\vec{e}_2)\\
  &=2^2+1=5
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
  \tilde{e}_1\cdot\tilde{e}_1
  &=(2\vec{e}_1+1\vec{e}_2)\cdot(2\vec{e}_1+1\vec{e}_2)\\
  &=2^2(\vec{e}_1\cdot\vec{e}_1)+2(2)(1)(\vec{e}_1\cdot\vec{e}_2)+1^2(\vec{e}_2\cdot\vec{e}_2)\\
  &=2^2+1=5
\end{align*}

The metric or fundamental tensor allows you to define fundamental properties like lengths and angles in a coordinate space
